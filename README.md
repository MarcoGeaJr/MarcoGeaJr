# Code is part of me.

I am a software engineer with a focus on backend development using the .NET platform. I have a special passion for software architecture and code design, always seeking to enhance my skills in this area.

I believe that well-designed architecture is crucial for the success of any software project, and I am constantly studying and applying best practices to create robust, scalable, and easily maintainable solutions.

In my daily routine, I also serve as a mentor, leading and guiding fellow developers, making strategic architecture decisions, reviewing code, prioritizing tasks, and creating CI/CD pipelines to ensure the seamless delivery of high-quality applications.

My essence lies in developing pragmatic, high-quality solutions with a professional and resilient approach, creating scalable systems that meet real user needs. I apply best practices in coding and architecture to ensure efficiency and robustness in every project.

Delight customers by delivering the solution. The right solution, at the right time.
